    "For the binomial theorem it holds: $ (a + b)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} \\cdot b^k $.\n",
    "So for $a = 1, b = 1, n = N$ we get: $2^N = (1 + 1)^N = \\sum_{k=0}^N \\binom{N}{k} 1^{N-k} \\cdot 1^k = \\sum_{k=0}^N \\binom{N}{k}$\n"

    "If a single-item-set $\\{c\\}$ with $c \\in \\{1, \\dots, 100\\}$ is frequent, it has to be at least in five buckets. This means more or less, that the number $c$ has to have at least 5 multiples with a lower value than 100. So for each value $c \\leq 20$, $c$ has five multiples $\\leq 100$. For example $c = \\{21\\}$ wouldn't have 5 multiples within the range and thus wouldn't reach the threshhold of 5. So all single-item-sets $\\{c\\}$ with $c \\in \\{1, \\dots, 20\\}$ are frequent.\n",

    "If a pair of items $\\{a, b\\}$ with $a, b \\in \\{1, \\dots, 100\\}$ is frequent, both pairs have to appear together in at least 5 buckets. That's the case, if the least common multiple (kgV in german) is below 20. For each multiple of the kgV, both $a$ and $b$ appear together in the corresponding bucket, since they are a multiple of the kgV which is a remainder of the multiple of the kgV. Also, they don't appear in any different bucket together. So if the kgV is above 20, $a$ and $b$ will be in less than five sets together, which means they aren't frequent. So the solution is:"
