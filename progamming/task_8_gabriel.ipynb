    "If a single-item-set $\\{c\\}$ with $c \\in \\{1, \\dots, 100\\}$ is frequent, it has to be at least in five buckets. This means more or less, that the number $c$ has to have at least 5 multiples with a lower value than 100. So for each value $c \\leq 20$, $c$ has five multiples $\\leq 100$. For example $c = \\{21\\}$ wouldn't have 5 multiples within the range and thus wouldn't reach the threshhold of 5. So all single-item-sets $\\{c\\}$ with $c \\in \\{1, \\dots, 20\\}$ are frequent.\n",

    "If a pair of items $\\{a, b\\}$ with $a, b \\in \\{1, \\dots, 100\\}$ is frequent, both pairs have to appear together in at least 5 buckets. That's the case, if the least common multiple (lcm, kgV in german) is below 20. For each multiple of the lcm, both $a$ and $b$ appear together in the corresponding bucket, since they are a multiple of the lcm which is a remainder of the multiple of the kgV. Also, they don't appear in any different bucket together. So if the lcm is above 20, $a$ and $b$ will be in less than five sets together, which means they aren't frequent.\n",
