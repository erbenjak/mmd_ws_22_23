\section{Exercise}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Student rating website}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Users: The students will be the different users 
        \item Items: The system knows different kinds of items: lectures, exams, seminars and professors
        other likes/dislikes: passing a exam, not finishing a course (dislike), practicals with certain professors,
        thesis with a certain professors
        \item Other likes/dislikes: not liking a image (dislike), commenting on a picture(possibly with sentiment
        analysis), liking a user profile (small appreciation for all said artist pictures)
        Dating profile
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Art sharing network}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Users: the artists/art enjoyers
        \item Items: the art pieces
        \item Other likes/dislikes: not liking a image (dislike), commenting on a picture(possibly with sentiment
        analysis), liking a user profile (small apreciation for all said artist pictures)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dating profile}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Users: the users signed up to the plattform
        \item Items: the attribute-values of the other users // the other users
        \item Other likes/dislikes: block (dislike), number of messages send (like)
    \end{itemize}
    This case is somewhat special since users are also the items. Without the description of there dream
partner and thier own answering of some questions this system would highly suffer from the new users
problem.
